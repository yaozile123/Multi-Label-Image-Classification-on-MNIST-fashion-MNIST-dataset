# mnist-with-error-analysis
## Purpose
Computer vision has become one of the most important area in computer science. During this project, we'll collected and pre-processed images from MNIST and fashion-MNIST images.You will see the performance of each model (Logistic Regressiom,svm, decision_tree, lightGBM) when they met hand-written/clothes images.In the end, this project will show how to do the error analysis over multi-labels. We will analyzed error on handwritten/clothes images and discovered several images are always easier to mis-classify than other numbers.
